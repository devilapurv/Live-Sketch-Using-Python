## Setup Discription 
### you need to install following libraries to run this python program in cmd
```

pip install Pytube
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python

```
## üöÄ Quick Start :

#### Step 1: Forking the repository :

To work on this project, you will first need to make your copy of the repository. To do this, you should fork the repository and then clone it so that you have a local working copy.

Get your own Fork/Copy of repository by clicking `Fork` button right upper corner.<br><br>

#### Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository

After the repository is forked, you can now clone it so that you have a local working copy of the codebase.

To make your local copy of the repository follow the steps:
- Open the Command Prompt
- Type this command:
  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/PythonProjects
```


#### Step 3: Creating a new branch (IMP)
This is one of the very important step that you should follow to contribute. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not creates a mess. To create a new branch:
  
```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
```bash
git pull origin main
```


## How to Contribute ü§î

You can contribute by adding new scripts, improving current scripts or documentation. Here are some instructions
before making a Pull Request:

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your own [Issues](https://github.com/Akshat-Pandey16/PythonProjects/issues)!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Fork the Repo and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working upon.
- Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.

### Steps to take to contribute üë£

- [x] Create an issue for making any changes to code. When the issue is approved you can make changes.
- [x] Pull latest change from upstream branch before starting the changing of code.
- [x] Add your file in a properly named directory (lowercase) with a README.md in it. Add requirements.txt if needed.
